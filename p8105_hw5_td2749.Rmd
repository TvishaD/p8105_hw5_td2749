# Problem 2: Homicide Data

```{r homicide_data set up}
homicide_data = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    unite(city_state, c(city, state), sep = ",", remove = FALSE) %>% 
    group_by(city_state, disposition) %>% 
      summarize(cases = n()) %>%
      pivot_wider(names_from = disposition, values_from = cases) %>% 
      janitor::clean_names() %>% 
      replace(is.na(.), 0) %>% 
      mutate(total_cases = closed_by_arrest + closed_without_arrest + open_no_arrest) %>% 
      mutate(unsolved_cases = closed_without_arrest + open_no_arrest) %>% 
      select(city_state, unsolved_cases, total_cases)

head(homicide_data)
```

**Raw Data Description**: The raw data consists of `r nrow(homicide_data)` rows of observations and `r ncol(homicide_data)` columns of variables. Each row identifies a distinct homicide victim's information. The variables are `r colnames(homicide_data)`. From these pieces of information, we get a picture of each victim's personal details, date of the homicide, location, and the disposition of the case. There are some missing values (NA) in the latitude and longitude columns. Most columns contain character values. Several cells in the `race`, `age`, and `sex` columns contain 'Unknown', reflecting the missing information regarding the specific individuals. There are some cities (Boston, Los Angeles, Louisville, Oakland, and Pittsburgh) where there are no cases labelled as "closed without arrest". 

```{r Baltimore prop.test}
balt_x = homicide_data %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD") %>% pull(unsolved_cases)
balt_n = homicide_data %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD") %>% pull(total_cases)

baltimore_proptest = 
  prop.test(balt_x, balt_n) %>% 
  broom::tidy()

# balt_unsolved_prop
baltimore_proptest %>% pull(estimate)

# balt_lower_bound
baltimore_proptest %>% pull(conf.low)

# balt_upper_bound
baltimore_proptest %>% pull(conf.high)
```

```{r tidy pipeline for all props}
homicide_prop_results =
  homicide_data %>% 
    mutate(purrr::map2_df(.x = unsolved_cases, .y = total_cases, ~broom::tidy(prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)))) %>% 
    select(city_state, unsolved_cases, total_cases, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
    rename(unsolved_prop = estimate) %>% 
    mutate(conf_int = paste("(", round(conf.low, 3), ",", round(conf.high, 3), ")")) %>% 
    select(city_state, unsolved_cases, total_cases, unsolved_prop, conf_int, conf.low, conf.high)

```

**NOTE**: The warning message reveals that chi-square approximation may be incorrect for "city_state = Tulsa,AL". This is because this group only contains 1 homicide case (total) and 0 unsolved cases. As there is no scenario of an unsolved cases proportion (0/1) here and as the total number of cases is only 1, it is not appropriate to perform a one-sample proportion test under these circumstances. 

```{r plot of estimate with ci}
unsolved_prop_plot = 
  homicide_prop_results %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(city_state, unsolved_prop), y = unsolved_prop)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
