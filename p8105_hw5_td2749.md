**Raw Data Description**: The raw data consists of 51 rows of
observations and 3 columns of variables. Each row identifies a distinct
homicide victim’s information. The variables are city_state,
unsolved_cases, total_cases. From these pieces of information, we get a
picture of each victim’s personal details, date of the homicide,
location, and the disposition of the case. There are some missing values
(NA) in the latitude and longitude columns. Most columns contain
character values. Several cells in the `race`, `age`, and `sex` columns
contain ‘Unknown’, reflecting the missing information regarding the
specific individuals. There are some cities (Boston, Los Angeles,
Louisville, Oakland, and Pittsburgh) where there are no cases labelled
as “closed without arrest”.

``` r
balt_x = homicide_data %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD") %>% pull(unsolved_cases)
balt_n = homicide_data %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD") %>% pull(total_cases)

baltimore_proptest = 
  prop.test(balt_x, balt_n) %>% 
  broom::tidy()

# balt_unsolved_prop
baltimore_proptest %>% pull(estimate)

    mutate(purrr::map2_df(.x = unsolved_cases, .y = total_cases, ~broom::tidy(prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)))) %>% 
    select(city_state, unsolved_cases, total_cases, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
    rename(unsolved_prop = estimate) %>% 
    mutate(conf_int = paste("(", round(conf.low, 3), ",", round(conf.high, 3), ")")) %>%

```

    ## Warning in prop.test(x = .x, n = .y): Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect

**NOTE**: The warning message reveals that chi-square approximation may
be incorrect for “city_state = Tulsa,AL”. This is because this group
only contains 1 homicide case (total) and 0 unsolved cases. As there is
no scenario of an unsolved cases proportion (0/1) here and as the total
number of cases is only 1, it is not appropriate to perform a one-sample
proportion test under these circumstances.

``` r
unsolved_prop_plot = 
  homicide_prop_results %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(city_state, unsolved_prop), y = unsolved_prop)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
      labs(title = "Proportion of Unsolved Homicides by City (2007-2017)",
           x = "Location (City and State)",
           y = "Proportion of Unsolved Homicide Cases",
           caption = "Proportions of unsolved homicides with associated 95% confidence intervals between 2007 and 2017 in major US cities.") +
